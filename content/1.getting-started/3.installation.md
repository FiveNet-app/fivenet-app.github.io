title: Installation
---

1. Download or build the FiveNet container images.
    1. Checkout the [`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/fivenet-app/fivenet/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml) as an example (the mysql included in it isn't needed as you would use your existing gameserver's database server).
    2. To build the FiveNet container image you need to have a [Nuxt UI Pro license key](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/pricing).
    3. Container images are available from [GHCR.io fivenet-app/fivenet registry](https://github.com/fivenet-app/fivenet/pkgs/container/fivenet).
2. Prepare config file for Fivenet, check out [configuration page](./4.configuration.md).
    1. Make sure to correctly set database details, public url and session/cookie domain.
3. Run the FiveNet server, worker and other components either via the `docker-compose.yaml` or manually via binary.
    1. For the server component you can add `--serve-frontend` to not have to run the frontend component as well.
4. Add the FiveNet server plugin to your FiveM gameserver.
    1. Example code can be found [here](https://github.com/fivenet-app/fivenet/tree/main/plugins/fivem/fivenet).
